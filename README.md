# SharePoint Online File Operations using Microsoft Graph API

This .NET 9 project demonstrates how to perform file operations in SharePoint Online using the Microsoft Graph API with OAuth 2.0 authentication and delegated access. The application facilitates seamless file interactions, leveraging modern authentication techniques and the capabilities of the Graph API.

## What is Microsoft Graph API?

Microsoft Graph API is a unified API endpoint that provides access to Microsoft 365 data and intelligence. It serves as a single endpoint (`https://graph.microsoft.com`) to access data across various Microsoft services including SharePoint, OneDrive, Outlook, Teams, and more. Key advantages include:

- **Unified Access** - A single API to access data across multiple Microsoft services
- **Consistent Data Model** - Standardized entities and relationships
- **Rich SDK Support** - Official SDKs for .NET, JavaScript, Java, Python, and more
- **Modern Authentication** - OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect support
- **Intelligence & Insights** - AI-powered features and analytics

In this project, we leverage Microsoft Graph API to interact with SharePoint Online document libraries and files.

## Features
- OAuth 2.0 authentication with delegated access
- File operations on SharePoint Online, such as:
  - Uploading files

## Usage

This section provides detailed instructions on how to use the API endpoints for SharePoint file operations.

### Understanding SharePoint Hierarchy

In SharePoint Online, the hierarchy is:
- **Site**: A collection of document libraries and other content
- **Drive**: A document library within a site (e.g., "Documents")
- **Path**: The location within a drive where files are stored

### Important Notes

- Use `root` as the `siteName` parameter if you are using the base SharePoint Online site.
- The default document library name in SharePoint is usually "Documents".
- File paths are relative to the drive root and should not include a leading slash.

### Available Operations

```

### Component Descriptions

1. **Client Application**: External applications that consume the API endpoints.

2. **Spo.WebApi**: ASP.NET Core Web API that exposes endpoints for SharePoint file operations. It acts as a fa√ßade over the core library.

3. **Spo.GraphApi Library**: Core library containing all the logic for interacting with Microsoft Graph API.

4. **GraphApiClientFactory**: Factory class responsible for creating instances of GraphApiClient with proper authentication.

5. **GraphApiClient**: Main class that handles all file operations by making authenticated requests to Microsoft Graph API.

6. **GraphApiAuthenticationHandler**: Handles OAuth 2.0 authentication with Azure AD and token management.

7. **Microsoft Graph API**: Microsoft's unified API endpoint that provides access to SharePoint data.

8. **SharePoint Online**: The destination service where files are stored and managed.

### Request Flow

1. The client sends an HTTP request to one of the endpoints in Spo.WebApi.
2. The controller in Spo.WebApi processes the request and calls the appropriate method in the Spo.GraphApi library.
3. The GraphApiClientFactory creates an authenticated instance of GraphApiClient.
4. GraphApiClient sends authenticated requests to Microsoft Graph API.
5. Microsoft Graph API interacts with SharePoint Online to perform the requested operation.
6. The response follows the same path back to the client.
